This is my 1\ :sup:`st` Sphinx page
======================================

This is my 1\ :sup:`st` attempt at writing Sphinx documentation

* First, I built a Sphinx documentation
* Then, I built my html pages
    * I built them with the ``make html`` command

This is a 2\ :sup:`nd` header
--------------------------------

This is my test of the 2\ :sup:`nd` header

* This is my new image that I uploaded

.. figure:: /image/una.jpg
    :align: left
    :alt: Otomachi Una image
    :scale: 30%

    **This is an example of Una image with a caption**
